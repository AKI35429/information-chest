## How to contribute

## Guidelines

Please help us follow the best practice to make it easy for the reviewer as well as the contributor. We want to focus on the code quality more than on managing pull request ethics.
- Single commit per pull request and name the commit as something meaningful, example: Adding <-your-name-> in students section.
- Reference the issue numbers in the commit message if it resolves an open issue.Follow the PR template strictly.
- Do not use unnecessary variables or functions and follow a easy and understandable code structure with proper comments.
- Provide the relevant screenshots for easier review.
- Pull Requests older than 2 days with no response from the contributor shall be marked closed.
- Do not make PR which is not related to any issues. You can create an issue and solve it once we approve them.
- Avoid duplicate PRs, if need be comment on the older PR with the PR number of the follow-up (new PR) and close the obsolete PR yourself.
- Be polite: Be polite to other community members.
